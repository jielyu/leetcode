#Leetcode# Q1366 通过投票对球队排名
难度：中
在特殊的排名系统中，每个选民对参加比赛的所有团队都按从最高到最低的顺序进行排名。
团队的顺序由谁获得最高排名第一的选票决定。 如果两个或两个以上的团队并列第一，
我们将考虑第二个位置来解决冲突；如果两个团队再度并列，我们将继续此过程，直到双方平分。 
如果在考虑所有职位后仍将两个或更多团队并列，我们将根据其团队字母的字母顺序对其进行排名。
给定一系列字符串投票，这是排名系统中所有选民的投票。 根据上述排名系统对所有团队进行排序。
返回按排名系统排序的所有团队的字符串。
约束条件：
(a) 1 <=票数。长度<= 1000
(b) 1 <=票[i]。长度<= 26
(c) 投票[i] .length ==投票[j] .length等于0 <= i，j <投票.length。
(d) 投票[i] [j]是英文大写字母。
(e) 投票[i]的所有字符都是唯一的。
(f) 出现在voices [0]中的所有字符也出现在voices [j]中，其中1 <= j <tickets.length。

示例1:
Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
Output: "ACB"
Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.

示例2:
Input: votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]
Output: "XWYZ"
Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. 

示例3:
Input: votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]
Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
Explanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.

示例4:
Input: votes = ["BCA","CAB","CBA","ABC","ACB","BAC"]
Output: "ABC"
Explanation: 
Team A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
There is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.

示例5:
Input: votes = ["M","M","M","M"]
Output: "M"
Explanation: Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.
